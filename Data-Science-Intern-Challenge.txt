1. 

a) The value 3145.13 was calculated by the order amount divided by the number of orders. There are many bulk orders being placed which is highly skewing the AOV. A better way to calculate the AOV would be to take the average amount of each item for every order. Average amount per item = (order_amount / total_items). Then, calculate the average amount per item for every single order. This would give you a new column which gives you the average amount per item for every order. Now, you can get the total of that column and divide it by total orders (which is 5000 in the data set).

In my spreadsheet attached, I have created column H which calculates the average amount per item for every order. The cells in green showcase this within the spreadsheet.

b) The metric that I would report for this dataset is the average amount per item for every order. 

c) The metric's value is 387.7428

a) The query below returned 54 orders shipped by speedy express.

SELECT 
  Count(*) 
FROM 
  orders 
WHERE 
  shipperid = 1;

b) The query below returned 'Peacock'.

WITH numofemployeeorders AS (
  SELECT 
    e.lastname, 
    o.employeeid, 
    Count(o.employeeid) AS TotalOrders 
  FROM 
    orders o 
    INNER JOIN employees e ON o.employeeid = e.employeeid 
  GROUP BY 
    e.employeeid 
  ORDER BY 
    totalorders DESC
) 
SELECT 
  lastname 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      lastname, 
      Max(totalorders) 
    FROM 
      numofemployeeorders
  );

c) The query below returned 'Boston Crab Meat'.

SELECT 
  ProductName 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      o.CustomerID, 
      o.OrderID, 
      od.ProductID, 
      p.ProductName, 
      sum(od.Quantity) as TotalOrders, 
      c.Country 
    FROM 
      OrderDetails od 
      Inner join Orders o on od.OrderID = o.OrderID 
      Inner join Customers c on o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
      Inner join Products p on od.ProductID = p.ProductID 
    where 
      c.Country = 'Germany' 
    Group by 
      od.ProductID 
    Order by 
      TotalOrders DESC 
    Limit 
      1
  );
